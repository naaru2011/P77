    <h1>Project on console</h1>
<h4>First, click the page with right click.</h4>
<h4>Once you have done that, click inspect.</h4>
<h4>After that, click console. If it says an error, refresh or hard refresh the page.</h4>
<h4>If it says no error, then you can see the variables! Now, let's get onto the coding.</h4>
<h4>Do main.js then make a var first_name. Then make another variable called second_name.</h4>
<h4>Now, make 2 more variables, a, which's value is 10, and var b, which's value is 5.</h4>
<h4>Make another variable called full_name, which's value is first_name + last_name.</h4>
<h4>You have to concatinate. The instructions are first_name.concat(last_name)</h4>
<h4>Now do the same thing with a and b, but add subracting and multiplying and dividing, and adding. Don't do the same solution like for first_name and last_name.</h4>
<h4>Do console.log everytime you make a new variable.</h4>
<h4>Also, in HTML, script it and source it with main.js for the js to work.</h4>
<h4>And now, your all done.</h4>
